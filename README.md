## Skills

#### Creativity  

Having worked as a creative in the television and publishing sectors, I pride myself on my ability to generate ideas and concepts. During my time at Dorling Kindersley, I came up with the story for How Machines Work: Zoo Break, a book that teaches the mechanics of simple machines through a narrative about animals escaping from a zoo. I also served as Ghost Writer on the project. It went on to win the Royal Society Young Personâ€™s Book Prize in 2016

#### Attention to detail

While working as an Editorial Assistant at Dorling Kindersley, one of my principal duties was proofreading copy for spelling and grammatical errors ahead of publication. I was expected to do it quickly and comprehensively. This has perfectly prepared me for picking out and fixing typos and errors in code.
