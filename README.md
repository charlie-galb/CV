## Skills

Consider skills relevent to software development. Then consider your best skills. Pick 2-4 skills and write a short descriptive paragraph for each one. You should demonstrate how capable you are at this skill with examples.

#### Creative

- Experience
- Achievements
- Evidence

#### Self-motivating

Descriptive paragraph of how capable you are at this skill and, if relevant, how it has developed.

- I achieved A during my work at B (job, or otherwise)
- I contributed to the growth of X while doing Y (job, or otherwise)
- I built this, made this, broke this, fixed this, etc.
- A link to some on-line evidence (blogs, videos, articles, etc.)

#### Attention to detail

- While working as an Editorial Assistant at Dorling Kindersley, one of my principal duties was proofreading copy for spelling and grammatical errors ahead of publication. I was expected to do it quickly and comprehensively. This has perfectly prepared me for picking out and fixing typos and errors in code.
