## Skills

#### Creativity  

Having worked as a creative in the television and publishing sectors, I pride myself on my ability to generate ideas and concepts. During my time at Dorling Kindersley, I came up with the story for How Machines Work: Zoo Break, a book that teaches the mechanics of simple machines through a narrative about animals escaping from a zoo. I also served as Ghost Writer on the project. It went on to win the Royal Society Young Personâ€™s Book Prize in 2016

#### Attention to detail

While working as an Editorial Assistant at Dorling Kindersley, one of my principal duties was proofreading copy for spelling and grammatical errors ahead of publication. I was expected to do it quickly and comprehensively. This has perfectly prepared me for picking out and fixing typos and errors in code. 

### Communication  

I am an excellent communicator, both in writing and in speech. I have written treatments for television companies, content and copy for books, and I possess a commercial copywriting qualification, in which I was awarded a distinction. While working as Teacher Coordinator for ILA Vietnam, I had to write and deliver workshops to teachers on a regular basis, as well as serving as Master of Ceremonies for various promotional events at my school. As a teacher of non-native speakers, I learned to value the role of empathy in communication. I had to modulate my speech to the level of my students if I wanted them to understand what I was saying. This skill is easily transferrable to the technology sector, where presentations are often delivered by professional programmers to an audience with little to no technical expertise.
